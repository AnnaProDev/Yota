						<div class="questions_item_name">What's Included in the dryer repair service?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Our electric and gas dryer repair service entails examining the appliance to identify possible issues, performing maintenance work, and repairing/replacing defective parts. Depending on the extent of damage, we’ll either repair your dryer on-site or transport it to our workshop.

						<div class="questions_item_name"> How much does it cost to repair a gas dryer?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">As with other appliances, the cost of repairing your gas dryer primarily depends on the extent of damage and the appliance’s brand. Many things can go wrong on a gas dryer, so your gas dryer repair bill depends on the issues we’re dealing with.Minor problems such as faulty dryer doors can cost as little as $40 to fix, whereas major defects such as broken thermostats can cause up to $150 to replace. Replacing a broken motor can cost as much as $450. On average, most of our customers pay between $100 and $180 for repairs.

						<div class="questions_item_name">What causes some electric dryer repairs to be expensive?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Generally, electric dryer repair is pretty inexpensive. However, the repairs can sometimes be expensive. Electrical issues are the main culprit if our technicians provide a seemingly high quote for a repair job. If your dryer needs a new heating element, the cost of repairing it will also be considerably high.

						<div class="questions_item_number">[04]</div>
						<div class="questions_item_name">Is It worth having a dryer repaired?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								The question of whether to replace or repair your gas or electric dryer depends on the problem you’re dealing with. Sometimes, repairing a dryer may not be a sensible decision, more so if it’s considerably damaged. If you’re unsure whether repairing your dryer makes sense, consider the 50% rule.
In line with this, don’t spend more than 50% of your dryer’s cost repairing it. So, if a dryer repair technician states that the repairs will cost more than $400, you’re better off replacing the appliance because the average cost of new dryers is $500-$800.

						<div class="questions_item_name">How long do dryer repairs take?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Typically, the dryer repair service takes an hour. However, the amount of time it takes to repair a dryer depends on the issue you’re dealing with. If the problem lies with a door that won’t open, our technicians will fix it on-site and within thirty minutes. However, more serious problems may require the appliance to be brought to our facility for thorough inspection and repairs.

						<div class="questions_item_name">Do you charge for repair services by the hour?
							<div class="questions_item_descr">
								Most companies that provide dryer repair in your area charge their customers by the hour. At YOTA Appliance, we charge a fixed rate for our services. Our electric and gas dryer repair rates are determined by the scope of service we need to perform and not by the amount of time we take to do the job.
