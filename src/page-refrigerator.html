				<div class="problems_info">Our technicians are well trained and licensed to repair all types of refrigerator problems. Some of the most common refrigerator problems we repair include:</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle problems_subtitle_1">
					<div>Refrigerator runs constantly</div>

				</div>

				<div class="problems_text problems_text_1">
				<span>If your refrigerator cycles or runs constantly, it may require an expert's attention. The most common problem with a continuously running fridge is dirty condenser coils. The fridge is less efficient and consumes more power, leading to higher utility bills.</span>	
			<span>Sometimes you may have set the fridge's temperature so low that it has to keep running to maintain the required temperature. Check that you have set the temperature correctly before calling your refrigerator repair provider.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Refrigerator not cooling</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Another common refrigerator failure is not cooling to the required temperatures. Condenser coils that do not dissipate heat adequately may cause your fridge not to cool. </span>	
			<span>The fridge's condenser and evaporator fans may also need replacement. Contact a refrigerator repair technician to get it fixed.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">The refrigerator is leaking</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Blocked drains or a clogged water supply line may cause leakage. Unblocking the drains or unclogging the supply line can fix the fridge.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">The refrigerator is too loud</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>If you notice that your refrigerator has become louder than usual, it indicates a problem that needs refrigerator repair.</span>	
			<span>Most often, the worn-out evaporator or condenser fan blades need replacing. Loose refrigerator parts may also obstruct the fan blades, causing the noise.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Ice maker is not working</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>You may discover that your ice maker is not producing as much ice as it used to produce before. Check to confirm that the freezer temperature is set correctly.  </span>	
			<span>You should set it to between zero and five degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature is set correctly and the ice maker won't work, call a refrigerator appliance repair technician to examine your fridge.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Food freezing in the fridge</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>When food freezes, it indicates very low temperatures inside the fridge. A broken thermostat or a damaged control board are the leading causes of very low refrigerator temperatures.  </span>	
			<span>Contact immediately a fridge repair company to prevent serious problems.</span>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="problems_item">
				<div class="problems_subtitle">Water dispenser not working</div>
				<div class="problems_text">
				<span>Modern fridges come with an in-built water dispenser. If your dispenser stops working, the water tube is frozen or blocked. You can try thawing the water tube and check that the freezer temperature is set correctly.</span>	
			<span>Contact a freezer repair service provider if this does not solve the problem.</span>
